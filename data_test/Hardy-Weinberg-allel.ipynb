    "# The Hardy-Weinberg principle\n",
    "In this exercise, we will warm up by manipulating some data from the 1000 Genomes Project and explore one of the most widely-used population genetics concepts, the Hardy-Weinberg principle. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "If we want to be doing population genetics, we'll have to come up with a definition of what a \"population\" is. We already have an idea of what a diploid species is: it's a set of individuals that can reproduce together. Within a species, we may find multiple groups whose individuals *tend* to reproduce together, because biology, geography, or cultural factors favor matings within the group. This tendency can increase the genetic similarity of individuals within the groups. \n",
    "We'll say that a *population* is a group whose individuals reproduce preferentially with each other because of an inheritable feature. The inheritable feature is typically not genetic: it can involve geographic factors (eg, Peoples of the Americas), as well as political (e.g., Canadians), cultural (e.g., French Canadians), or a mix of all these factors (e.g., Montreal Canadians fans). None of these groups are in reproductive isolation, but individuals are statistically more likely to reproduce with members of their group, and so they form populations in the sense of population genetics. But it should be clear that not all these groups are useful to study from a genetics perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "This brings up the question of why we need to define populations in the first place. In short, we define populations to help us build models of genetic diversity and evolution, when we think that each population can be described more simply than the whole species. For example, we often assume that indiviudals within a population behave in a relatively uniform manner. A perfectly uniform population never truly exists, and all our models are vast simplifications, but in many cases these simple models are sufficient to understand the biology that we care about. \n",
    "\n",
    "A particularly simple population is one where partners choose each other entirely randomly among all individuals. When that happens, the mathematical modelling gets much easier, because we don't have to model all the individual idiosyncracies. This is extremely convenient, and the random mating assumption plays a a central role in population genetics. The first thing we might want to do when looking at genetic data, therefore, is to check whether we can get away with this random mating assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conveniently, the random mating assumption makes a very clear prediction about the genetic diversity in a population: the chromosomes inherited from each parent should be no more similar, nor dissimilar, than any two chromosomes sampled at random in the population. Therefore, if neutral alleles $a$ and $A$ segregate in a parental population, with frequencies $p_a+p_A=1$, the probability of genotypes in the descendants is \n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{AA}=p_A^2$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{aA}=2 p_ap_A,$ \n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{aa}=p_ap_a$. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify that the expected proportion of $A$ alleles in the second generation is just  $p_A^{offspring}=p_{AA}+\\frac{p_{aA}}{2}=p_A$. Therefore, both the expected frequencies of alleles and of genotypes are conserved over time--this is the Hardy-Weinberg principle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even without looking at the parental population, we can sometimes see that the genotype distribution does not follow the Hardy-Weinberg principle. If the counts of alleles in a population are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\#_{AA}=100$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\#_{aA}=0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\#_{aa}=100,$\n",
    "\n",
    "we know that it's unlikely to have occurred in a randomly mating population--we can't find a $p_a$ and $p_A$ that match the data. If the data is consistent with the HW principle, we say that the allele is at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We'll explore a few situations where Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is not respected, but let's first look at some data and see what we find.\n",
